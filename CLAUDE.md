Serena Usage (MANDATORY)
Always use serena MCP tools:
find_symbol: Locate classes, functions, variables
get_symbols_overview: Understand file structure
find_referencing_symbols: Check dependencies before changes
insert_after_symbol / insert_before_symbol: For code insertion
replace_symbol: For refactoring
Never use grep/ripgrep when serena can do semantic search.
Never read entire files - use serena to get relevant symbols only.
